Pure Bootstrap Project


This is the first Bootstrap project that I made. I have only used Pure Bootstrap classes so that's why it has got some tacky colors. 

The varios Bootstrap classes used in this project are: 

Standard NAVBAR classes, CONTAINER-FLUID, ROW and COL. 

I have also added various breakpoints wherever necessary so that it becomes responsive. 

Thank You.
